        their team in London.</p> <p>Location: Caledonian Road, London</p> <p>Salary:

        Designer</b><b> – </b>About Us:</p> <p><br />We are Crucible; a team of consultants,
        marketers, and creative technologists united by a vision: to change the way
        businesses grow by realising the full potential of their digital ecosystems.</p>
        <p><br />Our mission is to challenge businesses to self-disrupt; to reimagine
        the way they deliver value to customers by plotting bold new paths.</p> <p><br
        />We’ve developed a new kind of digital business model; a hybrid Consultancy/Agency
        model that provides business leaders with the digital expertise and guidance
        to develop customer-centric strategies enabled and powered by digital experiences.</p>
        <p><br />After 6 years of operation the company is taking on some huge new
        projects and is keen to reinforce and expand its current design team with
        the addition of a new Middleweight Designer. Working on our various existing
        projects as well as new ones that you will  own, our aim is for our new Middleweight
        Designer to be a dynamic, creative force behind the work we do.</p> <p><br
        /><b>Digital Designer</b><b>- </b>The Role:</p> <p><br />The ideal candidate
        should be an eager all-rounder, keen to learn from the Crucible team and embed
        themselves within the current design team. You’ll be eager, innovative and
        daring in your concepts, and polished and professional in your portfolio.
        A relevant  bachelor’s degree can’t hurt, but a strong portfolio and agency
        experience is far more important. Please supply portfolio links or documents
        with your application.</p> <p><br />It is most important for the successful
        candidate to approach the challenge with an open, enthusiastic, and creative
        approach to the role. Designing for digital across all sectors, adaptability
        is key as the agency’s work ranges from substantial digital products  to small-scale
        websites. Our focus is on digital, but the successful applicant will also
        have the chance to work across brand and identity – sometimes for the same
        projects. This will mean you have complete creative ownership of your design
        projects.<br /><br />This is a ‘midweight’ position but has the potential
        to quickly grow as the company grows. It is an exceptional opportunity for
        the successful candidate to join at an exciting stage for the business and
        have the impact of their decisions felt in a small and  tightly knit company.</p>
        <p><br />Working alongside the senior designer, you may find yourself busy
        with any of the following:</p> <p>- Briefing meetings</p> <p>- Taking part
        in concept development discussions</p> <p>- Working on brand, digital UI and
        UX briefs from concept to completion</p> <p>- Generating concepts and ideas

        <p><strong>About The Role</strong></p> <p><strong>**44 Hours and 22 Hours
        Available Days and Nights**</strong></p> <p>The care sector is such a rich
        and rewarding place to work. There is variety in your work and in the roles
        available – you don’t have to be a carer to make a meaningful difference in
        our care homes. We want the kindest and most resilient people to come and  support
        our residents – no two days will be the same and you will receive the learning
        and development you need to thrive.</p> <p>As a Senior Carer at HC One, Kindness
        will be at the core of everything you do. It touches upon every aspect of
        our Dementia, Nursing, Residential and Specialist care homes. Every single
        person who works here understands that our residents are people just  like
        them with their own stories to tell. And, by joining us, you’ll have a wonderful
        opportunity to give something back to those people.</p> <p>For you, that will
        mean planning and implementing the kind of care that will give our residents
        a real sense of security, dignity and independence.&nbsp;You will get to know
        our residents and their families – helping to ensure we deliver truly personalised
        care  plans.<br /></p> <p>Leading a team of carers, you will be responsible
        for maintaining the highest standards of care and&nbsp;you’ll be a real influence
        on the rest of the team. Whether you are showing someone how to use a walking
        frame, helping someone at the end of their life to  eat a meal or talking
        to a resident’s family on the phone, you’ll do so with a sense of kindness,
        above anything else.</p> <p>Assisting the Registered Nurse and Care Manager,
        you will be involved in providing essential physical and mental stimulation
        through a range of social and recreational activities, as well as administering
        medication</p> <p>One of your key responsibilities is to maintain accurate
        records of the job you do and build strong relationships with the rest of
        your team.</p> <p>Become a Key worker and make difference.</p> <p>We are committed
        to providing the quickest possible turnaround from the point of making you
        a job offer to you starting with us on day one</p> <p><strong>About You</strong></p>
        <p>Ideally, you’ll have an S/NVQ 2 or 3 Diploma in Health &amp; Social Care,
        a background in person centered&nbsp;care planning and knowledge of caring
        for people with dementia. What’s essential, though, is your brilliant positive
        energy and natural ability to get along  with people. You’ll know what good
        record keeping looks like and be able to manage your time effectively. And,
        whenever you communicate with a resident or co-worker, you’ll be truly considerate
        and kind.</p> <p>Well, after all, it’s just in your nature.</p> <p><strong>About

        aspect of our Dementia, Nursing, Residential and Specialist care homes. Every
        single person who works here understands that our residents are people  just
        like them with their own stories to tell. And, by joining us, you’ll have
        a wonderful opportunity to give something back to those people.</p> <p>For
        you, that will mean planning and implementing the kind of care that will give
        our residents a real sense of security, dignity and independence.&nbsp;You
        will get to know our residents and their families – helping to ensure we deliver
        truly personalised care  plans.</p> <p>Leading a team of carers, you will
        be responsible for maintaining the highest standards of care and&nbsp;you’ll
        be a real influence on the rest of the team. Whether you are showing someone
        how to use a walking frame, helping someone at the end of their life to  eat
        a meal or talking to a resident’s family on the phone, you’ll do so with a
        sense of kindness, above anything else.</p> <p>Assisting the Registered Nurse
        and Care Manager, you will be involved in providing essential physical and
        mental stimulation through a range of social and recreational activities,
        as well as administering medication</p> <p>One of your key responsibilities
        as Senior Care Assistant is to maintain accurate records of the job you do
        and build strong relationships with the rest of your team.</p> <p><strong>About
        You</strong></p> <p>Ideally, you’ll have an S/NVQ3 Diploma in Health &amp;
        Social Care, a background in person centred care planning and knowledge of
        caring for people with dementia. What’s essential, though, are your brilliant,
        positive energy and natural ability to get along  with people. You’ll know
        what good record keeping looks like and be able to manage your time effectively.
        And, whenever you communicate with a resident or co-worker, you’ll be truly
        considerate and kind.</p> <p>Well, after all, it’s just in your nature.</p>
        <p><strong>About The Company</strong></p> <p>We’ll provide full training,
        so it’s a great opportunity to learn something new. In return, you will enjoy

        <p><strong>About The Role</strong></p> <p>The care sector is such a rich and
        rewarding place to work. There is variety in your work and in the roles available
        – you don’t have to be a carer to make a meaningful difference in our care
        homes. We want the kindest and most resilient people to come and  support
        our residents – no two days will be the same and you will receive the learning
        and development you need to thrive.</p> <p>As a Senior Care Assistant at HC
        One, Kindness will be at the core of everything you do. It touches upon every
        aspect of our Dementia, Nursing, Residential and Specialist care homes. Every
        single person who works here understands that our residents are people  just
        like them with their own stories to tell. And, by joining us, you’ll have
        a wonderful opportunity to give something back to those people.</p> <p>For
        you, that will mean planning and implementing the kind of care that will give
        our residents a real sense of security, dignity and independence.&nbsp;You

        truly personalised care  plans.<br /></p> <p>Leading a team of carers, you

        a meal or talking to a resident’s family on the phone, you’ll do so with a
        sense of kindness, above anything else.</p> <p>Assisting the Registered Nurse

        you’ll have an S/NVQ 2 or 3 Diploma in Health &amp; Social Care, a background
        in person centered&nbsp;care planning and knowledge of caring for people with
        dementia. What’s essential, though, is your brilliant positive energy and
        natural ability to get along  with people. You’ll know what good record keeping
        looks like and be able to manage your time effectively. And, whenever you
        communicate with a resident or co-worker, you’ll be truly considerate and
        kind.</p> <p>Well, after all, it’s just in your nature.</p> <p><strong>About
