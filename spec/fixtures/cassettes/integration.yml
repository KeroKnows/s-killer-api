        <p><strong>Green-Energy Backend Developer - saving the planet!</strong><br
        /><strong>Location: Edinburgh / hybrid remote.</strong><strong><br /><strong>Salary:
        &#163;35,000 - &#163;50,000 &#43; equity<br /><br /></strong></strong></p>
        <p>Transitioning to renewable energy is one of the best things countries can
        do to lower carbon emissions.</p> <p>But what about all the countries who
        don’t have big, centralised grid networks supplying energy to every building
        and appliance?</p> <p>How do we cut the use of 100 million diesel generators
        in Nigeria, or enable rural Indian or Congolese people to stop burning charcoal,
        diesel or wood for heating their food?</p> <p>Developing countries are suffering
        the direct impacts of extreme climate events already and know they need to
        decarbonise, but don’t always have the systems to do so, especially not at
        the scale needed.</p> <p>The solution isn’t one company becoming big enough
        to solve all these problems. The solution is empowering lots of companies
        to drive the transition from within communities, creating jobs and investment
        while also increasing resilience.</p> <p>That’s where this platform comes
        in; systems to facilitate the installation, management, monitoring and data
        analysis, along with payment systems to allow local companies to implement.</p>
        <p>Tech wise, Internet of Things, Python and Django are the holy grail here.
        But, given the rarity of holy grails, if you can complete a Python tech task
        you’ll be considered. You don’t need to be an expert, they’ve hired people
        in the past with very limited  Python experience who are still there.</p>
        <p>Exposure to DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, provisioning, testing, automation
        scripting and all those goodies will stand out, but soft skills and a passion
        for saving our planet are important too.</p> <p>You’ll join a team of four.
        Two mid-level Devs, a senior and recently hired Lead, and plans are to expand
        the team to about 7 or 8 in the first quarter of 2022.</p> <p>They’ll consider
        folks who’ve been using Java, PHP, Ruby, .Net, NodeJs or similar, so long
        as you’ve tinkered with Python - even if only for data science, scripting
        or algorithms.</p> <p>They’ve struggled to find people who truly care about
        our planet and can demonstrate that, so that’s something they’ll be keen to
        explore with you at interview.</p> <p>We can’t afford to push the developing
        world into making the same mistakes the global north made when it comes to
        fossil fuel dependency, extraction and exploitation.</p> <p>The role is mostly
        remote, ideally seeing folks in their Edinburgh office once per week, but
        there’s room to negotiate.</p> <p>If making a difference matters to you, and
        you’d like to turn your skills to delivering real impact, please apply.</p>

        <p><strong>Green-Energy Backend Developer - saving the planet!</strong><br
        /><strong>Location: Edinburgh / hybrid remote.</strong><strong><br /><strong>Salary:
        &#163;35,000 - &#163;50,000 &#43; equity<br /><br /></strong></strong></p>
        <p>Transitioning to renewable energy is one of the best things countries can
        do to lower carbon emissions.</p> <p>But what about all the countries who
        don’t have big, centralised grid networks supplying energy to every building
        and appliance?</p> <p>How do we cut the use of 100 million diesel generators
        in Nigeria, or enable rural Indian or Congolese people to stop burning charcoal,
        diesel or wood for heating their food?</p> <p>Developing countries are suffering
        the direct impacts of extreme climate events already and know they need to
        decarbonise, but don’t always have the systems to do so, especially not at
        the scale needed.</p> <p>The solution isn’t one company becoming big enough
        to solve all these problems. The solution is empowering lots of companies
        to drive the transition from within communities, creating jobs and investment
        while also increasing resilience.</p> <p>That’s where this platform comes
        in; systems to facilitate the installation, management, monitoring and data
        analysis, along with payment systems to allow local companies to implement.</p>
        <p>Tech wise, Internet of Things, Python and Django are the holy grail here.
        But, given the rarity of holy grails, if you can complete a Python tech task
        you’ll be considered. You don’t need to be an expert, they’ve hired people
        in the past with very limited  Python experience who are still there.</p>
        <p>Exposure to DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, provisioning, testing, automation
        scripting and all those goodies will stand out, but soft skills and a passion
        for saving our planet are important too.</p> <p>You’ll join a team of four.
        Two mid-level Devs, a senior and recently hired Lead, and plans are to expand
        the team to about 7 or 8 in the first quarter of 2022.</p> <p>They’ll consider
        folks who’ve been using Java, PHP, Ruby, .Net, NodeJs or similar, so long
        as you’ve tinkered with Python - even if only for data science, scripting
        or algorithms.</p> <p>They’ve struggled to find people who truly care about
        our planet and can demonstrate that, so that’s something they’ll be keen to
        explore with you at interview.</p> <p>We can’t afford to push the developing
        world into making the same mistakes the global north made when it comes to
        fossil fuel dependency, extraction and exploitation.</p> <p>The role is mostly
        remote, ideally seeing folks in their Edinburgh office once per week, but
        there’s room to negotiate.</p> <p>If making a difference matters to you, and
        you’d like to turn your skills to delivering real impact, please apply.</p>

        /><br />It was chaos yesterday in our office when our 100th box of celebrations
        opened, Maltesers went at once with tears over the last one (not really but
        you know there was ''who''s having the last Malteser then'') <br /><br />I
        think they''re overrated and I keep the floor happy with taking the bounty''s
        and also a big fan of a milky way.<br /><br />I had a catch-up with one of
        our clients yesterday who I think I''m in love with. We have done some spectacular
        work with them over the past 3 months and hired some very special folk for
        the team if I do say so myself!<br /><br />However, they need us to up the
        ante and get a solid pipeline of 6 engineers ready to start in Q1 next year.
        We''re looking for bounty lovers, folk who dare to be different, stand out
        from the crowd, whose coding skills are as hot as Mars and you Snicker at  the
        rest because you''re the best.<br /><br />The business was founded a few years
        back by two awesome people in their twenties who turned over &#163;30million
        last year and expecting a turnover of &#163;90million this year and organically
        grown a following to 2.4million around the world! It''s more than cool it''s  edgy,
        mega, exciting, epic!<br /><br />They''ve hired some expectational leaders

        Engineer on the team, you will help to define, and be involved across, their
        technology stack and will thoughtfully and incrementally create new features
        and products that delight customers and help drive the business towards an
        ambitious vision.<br /><br />This is a role that will be challenging and rewarding
